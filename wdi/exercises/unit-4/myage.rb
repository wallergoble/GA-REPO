# they're the two really old text editors
-begin 
this is how you do multi line comments in ruby
The people who use them are way faster than you using an electron editor
It's fucking crazy

when you gets or puts, it has a new line attached so if you:

puts 'hi'
puts 4
# => hi
# => 4

as opposed to

print 5
print 4

# => 54

so gets gets(lol) of that line

so when you got that input 

it was actually

123
# plu
it'll end up in two lines as oppose

-end
